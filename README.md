# Lambdas in Java 8 (Coding Dojo)

Code in this repo shoul help you try out lambdas in Java 8. If you already write lambdas every day, it's probably not a good fit for you. 

It was created as kata for a [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/) session, but (as with any kata) even a single person can still follow the instructions and learn on his (or her) own.

## Usage

* checkout
* run 
> gradle eclipse
* Import in Eclipse. Take a look at the classes `DatabaseOperations`, `DatabaseOperationsTest`, `Refugee` and `Country`.
* Follow instructions in `/doc/instructions.doc`.
 
It's tested with:
* Java 1.8.0_25
* Gradle 2.2 (+ Groovy 2.3.6)
* Eclipse Mars

This [tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html) was a big help for me when I was learning about lambdas myself. 

Have fun and please let me know if there is any mistake.
